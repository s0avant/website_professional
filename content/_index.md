##### Aimee M. Van Tatenhove, PhD

I am a quantitative ecologist with an interest in data integration and improving avian population modeling frameworks, to better estimate avian population trends and inform species conservation efforts. Currently, I am a Rose postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, NY, USA. My primary research focus is to refine avian population status and trend models by integrating diverse avian and environmental data sources, including eBird data. I work under the direction of Dr. Kylee Dunham, and closely with members of the eBird Status and Trends team. I completed my PhD at Utah State University in 2024, co-advised by Drs. Clark Rushing and Erica Stuber. My doctoral research focused on American white pelican demography, migratory connectivity, historical population drivers, and airspace use. My work centered around the population of white pelicans west of the Rocky Mountains, with a focus on white pelicans around Great Salt Lake. Previously, I studied seabird nesting ecology and impacts of climate change on avian elevation distributions. I've conducted field work on a number of different systems, in diverse settings, including residential passerine research in upstate New York, nocturnal seabird surveys in rural Japan, and alcid nest searching in remote Alaska.
Unless noted otherwise, all media on this site, including header photos, are my personal work.
