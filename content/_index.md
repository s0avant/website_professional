I am a quantitative ecologist with a strong interest in data integration to inform species conservation efforts. I am currently a Rose postdoctoral fellow at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/), where I use [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) data to improve avian population trend estimates and enable targeted conservation through innovative quantitative frameworks. My work is highly collaborative; I work under the direction of [Dr. Kylee Dunham](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/kylee-dunham/) and closely with members of the [eBird Status and Trends](https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends) team.

Communicating science to the public and investment in up-and-coming scientists is important to me, and both of these values show up in my past and current projects. Check them out [here](/media)!

Unless noted otherwise, all media on this site, including header photos, are my personal work.
